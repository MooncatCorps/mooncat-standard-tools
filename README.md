# Mooncat Standard: Formatting
This repository contains several configuration files which instruct formatters
on how to treat and format MooncatCorps code. 

It aims to make all MooncatContent uniform and readable. 

Mooncat generally abides by exploiting whitespace quite a lot and it does so
in order to make every token as visible as possible. Of course, we're not
putting whitespace around *each and every token*; just the ones we deem
most important and in need of explicit recognition.
