# MooncatCorps Standard Tooling
This repository contains several configuration files for formatters, linters and
much more. These have bee configured according to MooncatCorps standards in
order to keep a clean and consistent ecosystem.

These are configuration files that are completely independent of any projects
and thus can be ported anywhere without fearing forgetting to include
any particular components. All files can be used as-is.
